# Optimization
- Optimization models in Python and Julia
<hr>

These optimization tasks are centered around finding the best possible outcome.

They use *JuMP*, Julia's optimization library.


The following depencies are required to be installed from the Julia REPL

```julia
Using Pkg
Pkg.add("JuMP")
Pkg.add("Cbc")
Pkg.add("Plots")
```
